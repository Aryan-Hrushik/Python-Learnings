print function overriding 
common type
print("Hello") // prints the line Hello and moves the cursor to new line as the print function defination internally 
consits of a value called "end" which has a default value to end the present line and moves teh cursor to new line.
But we can override this by assigning a vlue to end and stop the cursor in the present line itself

print("hello",end="") // stops the cursor from moving to next line as we assinged end with a vlaue
the next line gets printed beside hello itself.

print("hello",end="")
print("HI")

OUTPUT:
helloHI
